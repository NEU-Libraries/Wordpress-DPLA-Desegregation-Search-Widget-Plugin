DPLA widget for Wordpress

An embeddable widget to search the Digital Public Library of America collections.
It's written in pure JavaScript and CSS.  It has no external dependencies on libraries such as JQuery or Twitter Bootstrap.
Nor do you need a DPLA API key.

Download the plugin from https://github.com/NEU-Libraries/Wordpress-DPLA-Desegregation-Search-Widget-Plugin.  Unzip the plugin and activate
it in your admin panel.

Then simply add the following to any Wordpress page/post:

```html
<div id="dpla_search_widget"></div>
```


The widget should look like this on your Wordpress page:
